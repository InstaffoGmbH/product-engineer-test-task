# Instaffo Product Engineer: Test Task

Mock data for the test task. The brief: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUutjBNYOUaEl6AXpywD1CZgS4dxOserZX3KwuOSMV8/edit

## Job config

Each file in `jobs/` is one job with the questions the company asks:

```json
{
  "id": "job-long",
  "title": "Senior Frontend Engineer",
  "company": "Nordlicht Software GmbH",
  "language": "en",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "numeric",
      "id": "salary_expectation",
      "question": "What is your yearly salary expectation in EUR?",
      "required": true,
      "profile_field": "salary_expectation",
      "must_be_below": 90000
    }
  ]
}
```

Questions are shown in array order unless you decide otherwise.

## Questions

Every question has:

| Field | Required | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `type` | yes | One of the types below |
| `id` | yes | Unique within the job. Used as the key in the answer payload |
| `question` | yes | Text shown to the candidate, max 255 characters |
| `required` | no | Default `false` |
| `profile_field` | no | The profile already holds this answer. See `profile.json` |

## Types

| Type | Options | Answer value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `text` | `multiline` (default `false`) | String |
| `date` | | String, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `boolean` | | `true` or `false` |
| `numeric` | `min` (default 0), `max` (default 100000000). Integers only | Integer |
| `select` | `options`: array of `{ "label", "value" }`. `max_choices` (default 1) | `max_choices` 1: the selected option `value` as a string. Above 1: array of selected option values |
| `file` | | File object, see below |

`max_choices` can be equal to or higher than the number of options. Then all options can be selected.

## Profile fields

| `profile_field` | Where in `profile.json` |
| :---- | :---- |
| `notice_period` | `notice_period` |
| `salary_expectation` | `salary_expectation.amount` |
| `city` | `location.city` |
| `german_level` | `languages`, entry with `"language": "de"` |
| `english_level` | `languages`, entry with `"language": "en"` |
| `years_of_experience` | `years_of_experience` |

## Screening rules

A company can reject candidates automatically with a rule on a question:

| Rule | Allowed on | Passes when | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `must_be_at_least` | `numeric` | answer >= threshold | Threshold 3: 3 and 4 pass, 2 fails |
| `must_be_below` | `numeric` | answer < threshold (strict) | Threshold 90000: 85000 passes, 90000 and 95000 fail |
| `must_be_true` | `boolean` | answer is `true` | |

A missing answer fails the rule.

## Validation

Job configs are written by recruiters and are not always clean.

- Question IDs must be unique. On duplicates, only the first question counts.
- A screening rule on a type it is not allowed on is ignored.
- A question with an unknown `type` is ignored.

## Answer payload

```json
{
  "job_id": "job-long",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "notice_period", "value": "3_months" },
    { "id": "salary_expectation", "value": 85000 },
    { "id": "eu_work_permit", "value": true },
    { "id": "focus_areas", "values": ["frontend", "design_systems"] },
    {
      "id": "cover_letter",
      "value": { "content_type": "application/pdf", "data": "JVBERi0xLjcK...", "file_name": "cover_letter.pdf" }
    }
  ],
  "screening": { "passed": false, "failed": ["salary_expectation"] }
}
```

- Multi-select answers use `values` (array). All other answers use `value`.
- Numbers and booleans are JSON numbers and booleans, not strings.
- Files: `data` is the base64-encoded file content. Accept PDF, DOCX, PNG and JPG up to 5 MB.
- Leave out optional questions that have no answer.
- `screening.failed` lists the IDs of all questions whose rule failed. `passed` is `true` when the list is empty.
